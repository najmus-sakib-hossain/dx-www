The uv package manager is currently the package manager for python - but I want to make dx-py-package-manager and dx-py-project-manager to be at least 5x better than uv in all aspects!

Use our dx binary dawn game changing features and io_uring on Linux, kqueue on macOS, IOCP on Windows
for max performance and reliability.

So, give me plan to beat uv and also show if we do it then show much we will better and faster than uv!!!

Here is more about uv that we have to beat:

```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv's documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they're not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo 'import requests; print(requests.get("https://astral.sh"))' > example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
<Response [200]>
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay 'hello world!'
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  """

  ------------
< hello world! >
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 3.13 3.14
Installed 3 versions in 972ms
 + cpython-3.12.12-macos-aarch64-none (python3.12)
 + cpython-3.13.9-macos-aarch64-none (python3.13)
 + cpython-3.14.0-macos-aarch64-none (python3.14)

```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>>
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4

**✅ Dual-Core Codegen Complete (Dec 12, 2025):**
- **Micro Codegen:** 548 lines, transpiles TSX to raw FFI calls for 338B
- **Macro Codegen:** 349 lines, generates `layout.bin` + HTIP glue for 7.5KB
- **WASM Compilation:** Successfully built valid WASM for boths

**Bundle Sizes:**
- **Micro:** 530B app logic + 22.8KB shared = **23.3KB total**
- **Macro:** 663B app logic + 996B layout.bin + 30.3KB = **31.9KB total**

## Quick Start

### Install dx-cli
```bash
# Install the unified CLI
cargo install dx-cli

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/dx-www/dx
cd dx
cargo build --release --bin dx
```

### Create a New Project
```bash
# Create a new app (counter, dashboard, or hackernews template)
dx new my-app --template counter
cd my-app

# Start development server with hot reload
dx dev

# Build for production
dx build --release

# Run with dx-js-runtime (10x faster than Bun)
dx run src/main.ts
```

### Write TypeScript, Get Binary
```tsx
import { useState } from 'dx';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div class="p-4">
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**The compiler automatically:**
- Selects Micro (338B) or Macro (7.5KB) runtime based on complexity
- Compiles TSX → Binary layout + WASM logic
- Generates optimized binary CSS
- Creates resumable state snapshots
- Produces a single `.dxb` artifact

## Complete Architecture

Dx is organized as a Cargo workspace with **47 specialized crates**, each focused on a specific domain:

### 🎯 Core Runtime (Web)
| Crate | Purpose | Size | Status |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| **core** | Linear memory manager with capability security | ~390 lines | ✅ Complete |
| **dom** | HTIP renderer using native `cloneNode()` | ~350 lines | ✅ Complete |
| **morph** | O(1) dirty-bit state patcher | ~380 lines | ✅ Complete |
| **sched** | RAF loop with 4ms frame budget | ~350 lines | ✅ Complete |
| **dx-client** | Full WASM runtime (Macro, 7.5KB) | ~1330 lines | ✅ Complete |
| **client-tiny** | Minimal runtime (Micro, 338 bytes) | ~200 lines | ✅ Complete |

### 🔧 Developer Tools

### ⚡ Development Stack (Language-Aware Tooling)

DX introduces a **Stack** abstraction that unifies language-specific development tools. Not every language needs the same tools—Rust has `cargo`, Go has `go`, but JavaScript has a fragmented ecosystem. DX Stack adapts:

```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript - full stack
dx stack run index.ts        # dx-js-runtime (10x faster)
dx stack bundle --minify     # dx-js-bundler (3.8x faster)
dx stack test --coverage     # dx-js-test-runner (26x faster)
dx stack install             # dx-js-package-manager (50x faster)

# Rust - no stack needed (cargo handles everything)
dx stack -l rust info
# → Rust has a unified native toolchain: cargo

# Python - partial stack (pip/poetry/pytest fragmented)
dx stack -l python run main.py
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Stack Components

## Code Organization & Implementation Standards

### Memory Management & Performance Philosophy
- **Zero-Copy Architecture:** All data structures use `&[u8]` slices or memory-mapped `SharedArrayBuffer` instead of cloning or heap allocation
- **No String Allocation Rule:** Strictly forbidden to use `String` or `Vec<String>` in hot paths; use `u32` indices and static lookup tables instead
- **Object Pooling Pattern:** Structs are reused per frame, never created/dropped per operation (Data-Oriented Design - DOD)
- **SIMD Optimization:** AVX2 pattern matching for imports/exports detection and verification (~0.6ms performance gain)
- **Stack-Only Execution:** No garbage collection; all computations use stack allocation

### Binary Serialization & Formats
- **DX ∞ Format (World Record):** 186 bytes for complex structures (73.4% smaller than JSON @ 699 bytes, 37.2% smaller than TOON @ 296 bytes)
- **Zero-Copy Bincode:** Little-endian binary serialization with `bytemuck` zero-copy struct casting to byte slices
- **Binary Cache System:** Persistent code cache using Blake3 hashing for instant warm builds and dependency verification
- **SIMD Tokenizer:** Parallel byte parsing for sub-microsecond deserialization (~1.9µs parse time)

### Rendering Architecture (HTIP Protocol)
- **Native DOM Cloning:** Uses browser's native `cloneNode()` C++ engine instead of Virtual DOM diffing
- **Batch Operations:** DocumentFragment accumulation and single flush-to-DOM to minimize layout thrashing
- **Frame Budget:** Strict 4ms maximum execution per frame; yields to browser if exceeded
- **Zero Reflow:** Template registration happens once at init; updates are pointer swaps and attribute patches

### State Management & Reactivity
- **Dirty-Bit Tracking:** Every Component State struct has `u64` bitmask header for O(1) change detection
- **SharedArrayBuffer Residence:** State lives in linear WebAssembly memory, accessible by Main Thread and (future) Worker Threads with zero serialization
- **Memory Resume Snapshots:** State snapshots enable instant page transitions (0ms navigation, no re-initialization)
- **XOR Differential Patching:** Network updates calculate byte-level XOR differences; client applies 20-byte patches instead of re-parsing megabytes

### Compilation & Code Generation Pipeline
- **Dual-Core Codegen Strategy:** 
  - Micro mode (raw FFI, 548-line codegen): 338 bytes for simple apps
  - Macro mode (HTIP templates, 349-line codegen): 7.5KB for complex apps
- **Intelligent Selector Algorithm:** Compiler automatically selects runtime based on:
  - State complexity (6+ variables or complex types → Macro)
  - Component count (≥10 components → Macro)
  - Event handler density (≥10 handlers → Macro)
  - Tree depth and JSX node count
- **OXC Parser Integration:** Fastest JavaScript/TypeScript parser available (Rust-native)
- **Cranelift JIT:** Stack-only execution with constant folding and dead code elimination

### Security & Capability-Based Architecture
- **Compile-Time Validation:** dx-form, dx-guard, dx-a11y audit all code during build phase (zero runtime overhead)
- **Capability Manifest:** Security capabilities verified at initialization via structured binary encoding
- **Ed25519 Cryptographic Signing:** All binary artifacts signed and verified (XSS-proof)
- **Input Sanitization:** XSS is mathematically impossible in strict mode; inputs sanitized before DOM access
- **Memory Safety:** `unsafe` blocks only at FFI boundaries; documented safety invariants for every `unsafe` call

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** 200+ unit tests across all 40 crates with 100% success rate
- **Real-World Benchmarks:** 19 JavaScript/TypeScript tests, 8 style benchmarks with detailed performance tracking
- **CI/CD Validation:** Every change benchmarked against Bun, React, and Next.js baselines
- **Zero Compiler Warnings:** Clean build output; all warnings treated as errors
- **Performance Regression Detection:** Automated alerting if any operation exceeds baseline by >5%

### Dependency Management & Crate Versions
- **wasm-bindgen (0.2+):** Low-level JavaScript FFI and interop layer
- **web-sys:** ALL relevant features enabled (Window, Document, HtmlElement, Template, SharedArrayBuffer, Performance, Worker)
- **js-sys:** JavaScript value manipulation (Uint8Array, WebAssembly.Memory, Object introspection)
- **bincode (2.0.0-rc+):** Zero-copy little-endian binary serialization
- **bytemuck:** Transmute structs to byte slices with zero runtime cost
- **bumpalo:** Per-frame arena allocation for temporary data structures
- **once_cell / lazy_static:** Global singletons for Template Cache and static lookup tables
- **oxc:** OXC parser (external crate, integrated as submodule)
- **Cranelift:** Code generation backend for JIT compilation
- **Axum:** Ergonomic async web framework for SSR server

### Edition & Compilation Targets
- **Rust Edition:** 2024 (latest stable) with all 2024 edition features enabled
- **WASM Target:** `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (minimum viable WASM, no browser-specific features)
- **Code Style:** Enforced via rustfmt.toml; all code must pass `cargo fmt --check`
- **Unsafe Blocks:** Only at FFI boundaries with comprehensive safety documentation
- **Linting:** Clippy enforced with strict configuration in .clippy.toml

## The Vision

**Dx is more than a framework. It's a paradigm shift.**

For 30 years, the web has been built on text: HTML strings, JSON payloads, JavaScript bundles. We parse the same data formats millions of times per second, waste CPU cycles on garbage collection, and ship megabytes of redundant code.

**Dx asks: What if we built for machines first, humans second?**

The result is a platform where:
- Applications are **413x smaller** than React equivalents
- Runtime performance is **10-80x faster** than Bun/Node.js
- Data formats are **73% smaller** than JSON
- CSS is **50x smaller** and **80x faster** to apply
- Security is mathematically guaranteed by compile-time verification
- The developer experience is still beautiful (with editor tooling)

This is not just an incremental improvement. This is **the Binary Web.**

Welcome to the future. Welcome to **Dx.**

**Built with Rust and WebAssembly**  
*Binary Everywhere. Zero Parse. Zero GC. Zero Hydration.*

**Star this repo if Dx excites you! ⭐**  
**Follow our progress as we march toward the January 1, 2026 launch.**

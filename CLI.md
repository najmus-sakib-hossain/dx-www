At root crates folder you can see cli folder and there, we are creating cli for dx - which is professional cli to serve dx services and its details!

What is dx cli? It is suppose to be the ai cli like claude-cli, gemini cli and other but for now I really need to do the basics first its only a ai cli it will much more features better than those but as today is 26/12/2025 and I am have to launce it at 1st january 2026 so I will skip the ai chat feature for later and will finish all dx tools usage and shell enhance into the dx

Dx cli 3 things:
1. Make dx tools to be used
2. Enhance shell commands
3. Control all dx tools and shell and also make dx binary updater, patcher, all dx tools manager

Give me a plan to create dx cli like vercel design and make the cli simple and professional!
In the cli plan please use io_uring on Linux, kqueue on macOS, IOCP on Windows for max performance and our dx binary dawn game changinge features and make sure as currently I am making dx cli ai chat features like others so we shuld really focus on running dx cli everywhere and make sure that it also works on everywhere and make it battle tested for all edge cases!

Your idea is awesome - Now here is my plan as in dx, like bun we are not only a cli program we have also terminal, lsp and editor extension so our idea is that when let's we a user will install react then as for dx-js-package-manager and for dx-js-builder we will be needed a dxm version of react but if we do that in front of a user when they are installing it via dx-js-package-manager then they will think its slow so in there we we will just only do the installing of the node_modules of react package and then in the background we will build cache for dx-js-package-manager and dx-js-builder so in that way we will cache they stuffs that will make beast over bun and other competitor under the hood and using this they can't possibly beat us they will need to control everything like us but as many of current solutions are not connected like our dx so it will just not make a sense to do that all specific stuff unlike dx - So, dx will win!!!

Right??

So, currently at crates dx folder we have dx cli code and crates forge folder we forge rust code so please make sure that dx cli gives controls to all dx tools and make the forge rust crate to run as a daemon that watche for files changes as VCS, and control other dx tools, use dummy tools instaces as I still need to do some work before actually integratting those tools to forge and then make dx forge can do all things that it suppose to do like traffic branch and everything else and in the cli we are not adding chat for now but put a logic so that when we create dx cli ai chat it can be updated with ai chat correctly without any hassle and connect forge with out dx extension at root extension folder and rename it to dx from dx serializer as we are adding other tools previously it was just working on serializer but now it will do much more so please name it to dx extension and make sure that cli, forge, serializer and extension works correctly!!!

I am creating a rust project called "dx-serializer" which is moth token efficient serialization for llms, fatest serialization for machine and most beautiful serialization for humans. LLMS don't love binary as they love text, So, we have to make it in a that we only care about token efficiency - I already added some logic to make serialization as token efficient as possible for llms with these features:
1. No spaces or new lines unless necessary
2. Short keys for common fields into single character keys
3. Use ^ for to mention the previous key to avoid repetition
Now, I want you to give me 20 more game changing features to make it more token efficient for llms. Please give me only the features with full explanation for each feature. Do not write any code, only features with explanation.

Here is more about dx-serializer:

Good, now we have to make dx-serializer most token efficient serializer for llms. Please give me total 30 game changing unique features with full explanation for each feature. Do not write any code, only features with explanation. That will beat toon by at least 5x than toon in token efficiency for llms. And make sure to give me example of toon vs dx-serializer for each feature. And tell if I apply all these features then how much token efficiency we can achieve compared to toon.

I already acheived that but now I want to add it like a way where in code editor like vscode it will show the serializer for human but in actual file it will be llm version. I already tried to create a vscode extension where whenever it sees a .dx or just "dx" file it will show human readable version but when saved it will convert to llm version. But I am stuck on how to achieve this. As its showing save problems in code editor

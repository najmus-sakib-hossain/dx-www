Currently we have "check" tool for dx at crates/check/submodules/biome folder but its using biome codebase but we want to beat biome performance by implementing our own version of check tool so at crates/check folder we will implement our own version of check tool for dx projects. And the reason I am mentioning the old codebase is that in there created plugins system for check tool that we can format and lint other languages as well so we can take some inspiration from there only after we beat biome performance at javascirpt and typescript projects first and then we can move to other languages as well.

So, please create dx-check at crates/check folder with following features:
